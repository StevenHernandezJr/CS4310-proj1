# CS4310-proj1

In this project, you are asked to simulate Distance Vector routing for a given network.  The main goal of this project is to study the impact of different factors on the convergence times to optimal routes.  You will be provided with multiple files that represent different network topologies.  Your simulator would need to build routing tables and then forward data packets until they reach their destinations based on the routing tables built.
